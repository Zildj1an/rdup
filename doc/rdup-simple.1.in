DESTINATION

.SH DESCRIPTION
rdup-simple is a frontend for 'rdup-up', 'rdup-tr' and 'rdup'. It will backup all directories and files given on the command line. It will
create a hard linked backup directory, where the backup is created.
With the optional +DAYS argument you can specify how far backup rdup-simple looks back for previous backups. This should be a
number in the range 1..99. It defaults to 8 days.
.PP
rdup-simple will create the directory '~/.rdup' and will store its administrative files there. This program does not need to be
run with root permissions.
.PP
The last argument of rdup-simple is used as the destination; the following destinations are supported:
.TP
.I ssh:///user@host/directory
Use 'ssh' as a protocol and 'user' as the remote user name. Store the backup in 'directory' on the remote server 'host'.
.TP
.I ssh://host/directory
Use 'ssh' as a protocol and the current username as the remote user name. Store the backup in 'directory' on the remote server 'host'.
.TP
.I file:///directory
Use '/directory' to store the backup, 'file://' is optional. Note: there are 3 slashes here.
.TP
.I /directory
Use '/directory' to store the backup.
.TP
.I directory
Use 'directory' in the current directory for the backup.
.SS
Making a backup
.PP
Making a backup is as simple as:
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
rdup-simple ~ /adm /vol/backup/$HOSTNAME
.EE
.in
.PP
~ and /adm are the directories to be backed up.
Multiple directories or files are allowed on the command line.
.PP
The backup will be stored in
.I /vol/backup/$HOSTNAME.
.PP
For the backup a YYYYMM directory is created.
In this directory specific day-dumps are placed.
So the first dump in October 2006,
will be created in 200610/01 and the second in 200610/02, etc.
.PP
You can use incremental dumps for ever,
there is no need to do a full dump every once in a while.
.SS
Remote backups
.PP
Note: for remote backups to work,
the receiving machine must have rdup installed.
Also note: there is no colon between the
hostname and the directory. Remote backup will create a pipeline of the form:
rdup -c DIR|FILE | ssh user@remotehost
.PP
There is no provisioning for ssh so unless you have configured ssh to work without a passphrase you will be asked to supply one.
